We created a webscrapping tool to import levels from a website, 
wordcookies.info . This gave us over 6000 html files, each one representing 1 
level. We condensed several of theses into game.json files. We deleted 
most of the html files but left several in case the graders would like to test
the extractor features. This somewhat distorts our lines of code count, but can
be ignored.
